# Simple Single Page Soundboard
This code creates a Soundboard on a single page using PHP, Javascript, JQuery, HTML5 and CSS. I was motivated to create when Soundboard.com ignored my two feature requests. This version is better than Soundboard.com in at least 3 ways:
  1. Loads way faster.
  2. Tablet and Mobile friendly. 
  3. Sorts alphabetically automatically.  

### Getting Started
  1. Create a new folder and place all the MP3 drops you wish to have on the soundboard.
  2. On the top of the index.php file define that folder where is says $mp3directory. 
  3. Deploy. 

### Some Ideas For Your Soundboard
  1. Search for "CSS Button Generator" to create your own custom super cool looking buttons. Place that CSS into the sb.css file.  
  2. I set the preload: none. This is because I have 200+ drops and want the initial page draw to be fast. Remove this line if you prefer the drops load on page draw and not on play. 
  
### Demo
  This is the [Neil Rogers Soundboard](http://neilrogers.org/soundboard/) built using this code.
